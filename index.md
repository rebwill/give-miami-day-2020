Greetings! I'm glad you're here.

## All I want for [my birthday] is [change]

My birthday has been on November 19th since way back in 1990. Yes, that means that this year is the big 3-0 for me, as well as another happy coincidence: it turns out that I am sharing the day with our beloved Give Miami Day! It occurred to me that this is a wonderful chance to turn my birthday into a chance for larger impact.

There are so many organizations doing incredible and necessary work in South Florida, but I've narrowed it down to a few that are particularly near and dear to my heart. If — at the risk of being presumptuous — you were considering getting me something for my birthday, **I'd love nothing more than for you to redirect those resources to a donation to one of the below organizations between November 16-19th**.

**1. [Miami Waterkeeper](https://www.givemiamiday.org/rebecca-mwk)**

The word that comes to mind when I think of Miami Waterkeeper's work is FIERCE. They are fierce when it comes to legal advocacy for our waters — a strategy that is both effective and unique among science- and community-based nonprofits in the marine sector. Their work has played a critical role in protecting our reefs from development projects and pollution; working to end sewage leaks that threaten our ecosystem; applying pressure to the Turkey Point Nuclear Plant to clean up its environmental impacts; the recently successful campaign to reduce fertilizer runoff into Biscayne Bay, which causes both acute and chronic die-offs of seagrass and marine life; among many more efforts.

Along with their legal advocacy efforts, Miami Waterkeeper runs science and research programs, keeping their finger on the pulse of Biscayne Bay, along with community outreach programs training local residents to become defenders and advocates of our waters. Whether we know it or not, we *all* rely on Miami Waterkeeper's efforts much more than many of our residents and leaders realize. **Join me in protecting the lifeblood of our community — clean water and healthy marine ecosystems — and supporting Miami Waterkeeper this Give Miami Day.**

**2. [WeCount!](https://www.givemiamiday.org/rebecca-wc)**

Low-wage, immigrant agricultural workers are among the hardest hit communities by COVID-19. With few resources even before the pandemic, affected by layoffs in many industries, and ineligible for most state or federal forms of assistance, many families are struggling to meet basic needs like food and housing. All of this is compounded to their struggles even before the virus, like wage theft, working conditions, and legal vulnerability. 

WeCount! works to provide legal, social, and survival support for these families, and in April launched a mutual aid fund that has distributed nearly $200,000 in direct cash assistance to immigrant workers, along with broadcasting health and safety information related to the coronavirus via their community radio station, Radio Poder 97.7 FM. **Join me in supporting WeCount! and extending our resources to some of the members of our community who are struggling the most.**
